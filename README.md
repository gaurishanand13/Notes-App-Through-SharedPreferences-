# Notes-App-Through-SharedPreferences-
In this i have converted an array of strings directly to a string and reverse too(i.e string to arraylist<strings>) with the help of the helper class which you can get it here
http://androiddevcourse.com/ObjectSerializer.html. Therefore this helper class made the notes app easy to make as we can directly convert the array to a string and directly store through shared preferences in one line and don't need to store each note turn by turn
